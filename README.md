# Academic Risk Prediction Model

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting student dropout risk using Machine Learning techniques.  
The system analyzes academic performance, attendance, and demographic data to identify students who are at risk of discontinuing their studies.

Early prediction helps educational institutions take preventive actions and improve student retention.
